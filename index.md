I am a third year doctoral researcher at Loughborough University under the supervision of [Andrea Soltoggio](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/compsci/staff/academic-teaching/andrea-soltoggio/) and [Wen-Hua Chen](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/aae/staff/wen-hua-chen/). My research is focused on the development of lifelong learning agents capable of rapid adaptation and learning. To this end, my research cuts across several areas in machine learning, which includes: neuromodulation, neuroevolution, meta-reinforcement learning, continual learning, and hebbian learning. My work is funded by DARPA lifelong learning machines (L2M) and DARPA shared-experience lifelong learning (ShELL) projects.
